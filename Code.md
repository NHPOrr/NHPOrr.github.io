## BLoSSOM

I developed **BLoSSOM** (Boundary, Location, Symmetry, Structure, Orientation and Misorientation), a MATLAB-based analysis toolkit designed to characterise crystalline order directly from particle coordinate data.

The software identifies:
- Grain boundaries  
- Local symmetry  
- Crystal orientation  
- Misorientation between grains 
- Structural disorder within crystalline systems  

The source code is openly available on GitHub:

The repository includes:
- Guide
- Example dataset

The methods implemented in BLoSSOM are described in:
