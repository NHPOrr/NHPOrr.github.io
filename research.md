# Anti-counterfiet solutions from 2D colloidal crystals
To tackle the prevelant problem of counterfeit we are developing physical uncloneble markers made of 2D collodial crystals. The idea here is that even though we follow the same synthesis steps each time, the pattern of grains and grain boundaries that we create is different for each crystal. This is similar in spirit to how every snowflake has a different shape. However, the beauty here is that colloidal crystals produce structural colour from the interaction of the micrometric lattice of colloidal beads and visible light. This structural colour is visible with simple optics, like those found in a phone camera, alowing easy access to the
