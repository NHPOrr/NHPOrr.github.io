## Anti-counterfiet solutions from 2D colloidal crystals

<div style="text-align: justify;">
To tackle the prevelant problem of counterfeit we are developing physical uncloneble markers made of 2D collodial crystals (see the image below which contains several crystals). The big idea is that even though we follow the same synthesis steps each time, the pattern of grains and grain boundaries that we create is different for each crystal, and, thus, unclonable. This is similar in spirit to how every snowflake has a different shape. However, the beauty here is that each colloidal crystal grain produces structural colour from the interaction of the micrometric lattice of colloidal beads and visible light. What results is a patchwork of colours that is visible with simple optics, like those found in a phone camera, allowing easy access to the unique grain structure. Through analysis of the structure and comparison to a database of known crystals, the authenticity and provenance of a linked product can be ensured.

## Measuring and controlling colloidal crystal structure
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I have developed tools for extracting detailed structure within crystals which have enabled intricate details of crystallisation mechanisms to be revealed. The image below shows an example of crystal structure and grain bounadry analysis. Read more here:

Specifically, we showed that crystallisation can be controlled so that large monodomains of colloidal crystals can be produced under shear. We also uncovered the mechanism where hexagonal planes of particles form before the planes organise amoungst themselves. Read more about it here: 

In another project we are illucidating the transient structures during homogeneous crystal nucleation in a supercooled colloidal fluid.
