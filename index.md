## About Me
I am a researcher working on problems of soft condensed matter. I am (most) interested by colloids and polymer networks. My favourate techniques include microscopy and scattering. Currently, I am looking for positions anywhere in the world! 

Check out my instagram below for some beautiful symmetric things I have found in the wild.
