## About Me
I am a researcher working on problems of soft condensed matter. Specifically, I am (most) interested by colloidal crystallisation, colloidal synthesis and fracture in polymer networks using both microscopy and scattering techniques. Currently, I work as a postdoc at Département de Chimie in Ecole Normale Supérieure, Rue d'Ulm in Paris, France. 

Check out my instagram below for some beautiful symmetric things I have found in the wild.
