## About Me
I am a researcher working on problems of soft condensed matter. I am interested in colloidal crystallisation, colloidal synthesis and fracture in polymer networks using both microscopy and scattering techniques. I am currently a postdoc at Département de Chimie in Ecole Normale Supérieure, Rue d'Ulm in Paris. Check out my instagram below for some beautiful symmetric things I have found in the wild.
